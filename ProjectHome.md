A fully scalable color wheel/color picker for iOS applications.

Most other open source color picking solutions simply grab colors out of a gradient image. This works alright, but the color picker must always be the same size, and the quality and accuracy of the colors is dependent on the image. This project aims to create a color wheel that mathematically generates the entire color pallet, giving you a 100% scalable view and much more accurate color selection.

Color wheels are based on color selection with HSB (Hue, Saturation and Brightness) color space. Angle is hue, saturation is distance from the center, and brightness is controlled with a separate slider.

Included is single standalone class and example project.
